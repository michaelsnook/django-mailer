=============

A FLOSS django mailer for activist orgs, built by volunteers

Who should use it?
------------------

Our intended user is a small advocacy organization with very low yearly
budgets (Under $500k / yr), around 1 tech staffer, (a web developer familiar
with Django, server maintenance, and troubleshooting), and a small team of
organizers/digital campaigners who frequently engage in highly segmented,
heavily tested, rapid response campaigning

WISH LIST
=========

*Note: Everything on here is up for debate.
Please endorse good ideas with your name in [brackets].*

1. [QJ, Snook] Use Anymail to abstract ESPs
1. [Snook] Markdown editor (force campaigners to learn md, no wysiwyg offered)
1. [Snook] Realtime collaboration for the editor (many small orgs have distributed offices)
1. [Snook] Something like handlebars for {{ vars }} in the email itself
1. [Snook] A small datastore for the mailer itself (assume most real data about members is stored in an external data warehouse)
1. [Snook] Webhooks send user interaction data back to another service
1. [Snook] Bulk import API allows external services to set user identity, targeting, segmentation data from afar
1. [Snook] Simple tagging interface that doesn't attempt to apply targeting logic at the application layer
1. [Snook] CSS inlining (write a bit of CSS in one place, have it apply inline styles to html before sending)
